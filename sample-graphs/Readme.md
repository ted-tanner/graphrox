# Sample Graphs

These sample graphs can be read by the GraphRox library using the `GphrxGraph.load_from_file` function from the Python library, or by passing the file into the `gphrx_from_byte_array` function from the C library (the Python library calls `gphrx_from_byte_array` to read the files).

These graphs are provided courtesy of Stanford University. Follow [this link](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/) to find the graphs provided by Stanford. The citations for the graphs are listed below:
